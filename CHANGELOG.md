# Changelog

All notable changes to this integration are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/lang/de/).

The section headings have to match the release tags: the release workflow
reads the section for the tag it was started with and refuses to publish
without one.

## [1.3.2] – 2026-08-23

Documentation only — the integration and the card are byte-for-byte those of
1.3.1.

### Fixed

- The two card screenshots stayed blank in HACS. They were linked relatively,
  which GitHub resolves against the repository while the Home Assistant
  frontend resolves it against the HA instance — so the browser asked the
  wrong host and got a 404. They are absolute raw URLs now.

### Changed

- The README leads with requirements and installation instead of ~300 lines
  of reference, and has a table of contents; configuration, entities, cards,
  automation, operation and development follow in that order.
- Four statements in it did not match the code and were corrected: the scrape
  duration covers three parallel queries, not two; active decisions always
  comes from `cs_active_decisions` and never from the length of the
  `/v1/decisions` list, which is what makes it count CAPI and blocklist bans;
  reachable means the instance answered on any of the three queries; last
  update is the last scrape in which no query failed.
- The options are a table with defaults and the two validation rules, the
  minimum Home Assistant version is documented rather than living only in
  `hacs.json`, the WebSocket commands are described under Development with
  the note that they are not a stable API, and the YAML examples use `action:`
  instead of the deprecated `service:`.

## [1.3.1] – 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- The card announced itself as version 1.0.0 in the browser console no matter
  which release it shipped in. The number was a second, hand-maintained copy
  that had drifted three releases behind the package it labelled. It is now
  taken from `card/package.json` when the bundle is built — the copy the
  release workflow already checks against the tag — so it cannot go stale
  again. Nothing but the console line changes; the integration itself is
  identical to 1.3.0.

### Internal

- The card is type-checked in CI. The job ran the tests and the bundle but
  never `tsc`, and the elements themselves have no unit tests, so a type error
  in them was only caught when it happened to break the bundler as well.
- TypeScript 7 is held back: it is the native port, and its JavaScript API no
  longer has the shape `@rollup/plugin-typescript` reads. A weekly probe
  builds the card against TypeScript 7 and opens an issue if it ever succeeds,
  so the hold has a way of ending other than somebody remembering it
  (see [rollup/plugins#2016](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/2016)).
- Dependency updates: vitest 4, the rollup plugin group, and the GitHub
  Actions to their current majors, which clears the Node 20 deprecation
  warning from every workflow run.

## [1.3.0] – 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **A sensor now waits on the query its value comes from, not on the cycle as
  a whole.** Each update makes three independent requests, and a single one
  failing used to mark *every* measured value `unavailable` — an alert
  timeout blanked the counters of a metrics scrape that had just succeeded and
  tore a gap into the recorder's statistics for data that was never in doubt.
  With the alert route stuck, `New bans (24 h)` and the three `Top …` sensors
  go unavailable while `Active decisions`, `Lines per minute` and the rest keep
  updating. A failing decision query no longer touches any sensor at all — the
  ban table travels over the WebSocket.
- **`Reachable` means the instance answered at all**, which is the question a
  connectivity sensor is about. It used to mean "all three queries came back"
  and switched off over a single stuck route. That a route is stuck is now
  reported by `Status`, whose `reasons` attribute names it — it lists every
  failed query regardless of reachability, so a permanently broken alert route
  can no longer pass unnoticed behind working metrics.
- `Last update` keeps the strict meaning: the last cycle in which *everything*
  came back, since that is what an automation compares against to spot stale
  values. `Last restart` and `Last alert` are carried over from the previous
  cycle only when their own query failed — a working alert query with an empty
  24 h window has to be able to clear the timestamp instead of freezing it.

### Fixed

- **Diagnostics handed out the banned addresses.** The redaction replaced the
  `value` of every table row but left `key`, which is assembled from the
  address itself (`hist:<ip>:…`, `val:<origin>:<ip>`). Diagnostics get pasted
  into public issues. The key now keeps only its kind; a decision ID, which is
  not an address, stays readable.
- **A ban that worked could be reported as a failure.** After placing the ban
  the command reads the state back for the card, and that read sat outside the
  error handling — a hiccup right after a successful ban surfaced as an error,
  telling the user the opposite of what had happened. The read-back can no
  longer fail the command; a lost answer is flagged the same way the lookup
  flags it, so the card says "cannot tell" instead of guessing.
- The card header printed a literal `{local}`: the text carried a third
  placeholder that the card never filled.
- The instance picker of the bans card showed the wrong entry. The selection
  was set as a property on the `<select>` before its `<option>` elements
  existed, so it fell back to the first one and never corrected itself.
- The lookup card offered an unban button that did nothing for a local
  decision the LAPI does not know by ID. It now falls back to the route by
  address, the same way the ban table already did.

## [1.2.0] – 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Lookup card** (`custom:crowdsec-ip-lookup-card`): checks one address or
  range against every source — local decisions, CAPI and blocklists — and
  finds a range that contains it, which the ban table structurally cannot
  show. Includes the 24 h alert history for the address, plus ban and unban.
  It queries live and covers every origin, because the question is whether the
  address is blocked at all — unlike the ban table, which lists what can be
  acted on.
- Reconfigure flow: addresses and credentials of an existing instance can be
  changed in place instead of deleting the entry and setting it up again.
  Leaving a secret field empty keeps the stored value.
- Repair issue when the LAPI refuses the decision list to the machine token.
  It offers to add a bouncer API key and checks it before storing it — so far
  the reason for an empty ban table sat in a log warning.
- Option `alerts_full_interval` (see below).
- Tests for everything with a Home Assistant dependency (`tests/ha/`), plus
  ruff, mypy, coverage and dependabot in CI.

### Changed

- **Alerts are polled in two speeds.** Every cycle used to refetch the whole
  24h window, which with the window splitting behind it could mean sixteen
  requests per cycle. The window is now kept in the coordinator: a full query
  refreshes it every `alerts_full_interval` seconds (default 300), and each
  cycle only asks for the minutes since the last one. A new ban is still
  noticed within one cycle.
- **The ban card shows local decisions only.** An instance subscribed to a
  blocklist enforces hundreds of thousands of decisions, none of which can be
  lifted from the card, and an address caught by a range would not be findable
  in a table anyway — the lookup card answers that instead. The origin filter
  chips and the card's `origins` option are gone with it, and the "Active
  decisions" sensor keeps counting everything via the metric.
- The card's table is capped at 2000 rows and the rows travel through the
  WebSocket connection page by page instead of in one message.
- The diagnostics no longer contain the LAPI and metrics host names; scheme,
  port and path stay.
- Both cards render the same decision table from one module: same columns,
  same expandable rows, same per-row unban. The lookup card gained the
  country, operator and action columns it lacked.
- The "AS" column is called "Netzblock-Betreiber" / "Network operator" — the
  cell holds the operator of the address block, not the protocol's acronym.
- German wording of the lookup card: it used its own keys and said "Alle
  Decisions entfernen"; it now shares the ban card's phrasing, which names
  the address it acts on.

### Fixed

- Unloading one instance removed the services while a second instance was
  still loaded.
- IP addresses are validated with `ipaddress` instead of a pattern, which let
  `1.2.3.4.5`, `::::` and a `/999` prefix through to the LAPI.
- Ban durations may be composite (`1h30m`); the day unit is now refused up
  front, since neither Go nor CrowdSec knows it.
- The `ip` field of the WebSocket delete command was not validated at all.

## [1.1.0] – 2026-08-15

### Added

- Decision management from Home Assistant: bans can be created and deleted
  through the LAPI, including duration and reason (`decisions.py`).
- WebSocket API as the bridge between the frontend and the decision
  handling (`websocket_api.py`).
- Lovelace card `crowdsec-bans-card` with search, filters, unban button, a
  graphical editor and German/English localisation.
- Release pipeline that runs the tests, builds `crowdsec.zip` for HACS and
  publishes the release.

### Changed

- Reworked API and coordinator layer: pagination, error handling and the
  alert processing were pulled apart into separate modules.
- Code comments and documentation translated from German to English.

## [1.0.1] – 2026-08-14

### Added

- Example package for push notifications and the app badge in the Home
  Assistant Companion app on iOS/iPadOS. It is built for attack peaks and
  sends one buffered summary instead of a push per ban
  (`examples/ios_push_badge.yaml`).

## [1.0.0] – 2026-08-14

### Added

- First release: CrowdSec instance as a device in Home Assistant, with
  sensors for the Prometheus metrics, a problem indicator, services and an
  event on a new ban.
