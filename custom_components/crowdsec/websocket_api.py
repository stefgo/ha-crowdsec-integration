"""WebSocket commands for the Lovelace card.

The card needs more than an entity state can carry: a whole table with one row
per decision, and a way to remove a single one. Both go through these commands
rather than through attributes — attributes are size-limited, kept in the state
machine and recorded by the recorder, none of which a ban list wants.
