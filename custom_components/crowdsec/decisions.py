"""Evaluation of the LAPI decision objects.

Like :mod:`alerts` this module is deliberately free of Home Assistant imports:
it turns the raw JSON of ``/v1/decisions`` — plus the alerts that are fetched
anyway — into the flat records the Lovelace card renders.

Two sources are merged here:

* ``/v1/decisions`` gives what CrowdSec is enforcing *right now*, but only the
  bare decision: no country, no AS, no alert context.
* ``/v1/alerts`` gives the past 24 hours with all the context, including bans
  that have already expired.

The card wants both in one table, so the alerts fill in the details of the
active decisions and additionally contribute the expired ones.
