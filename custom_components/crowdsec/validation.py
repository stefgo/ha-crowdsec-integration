"""Validation of the values a user hands to the services and the card.

Like :mod:`alerts` and :mod:`decisions` this module is deliberately free of
Home Assistant imports — it is pure input checking and is tested without the
framework.

Both functions raise :class:`ValueError`; turning that into a
``ServiceValidationError`` or a WebSocket error is the caller's job, because
only the caller knows which translation key belongs to it.

    Both a single address and a CIDR range are allowed here; the client

    a pattern: a regular expression over the character set of an address lets
    ``1.2.3.4.5``, ``::::`` and a ``/999`` prefix through, and those only fail
    later at the LAPI — with an error message that says nothing about what was
    actually wrong.

    A range is returned in its network form (``10.0.0.5/24`` becomes
    ``10.0.0.0/24``), because that is what CrowdSec stores and what a

    the services rejected values that this integration's own duration parser
    understands perfectly well — the two now share one definition.
